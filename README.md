# 🧠 Gemma's Glow-Up: Fine-tuning with LoRA Magic ✨

Welcome to the coolest corner of the AI universe! 🌟 This project isn't just about fine-tuning a language model; it's about giving Gemma a fabulous makeover using the power of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Get ready to witness a transformation that would make any AI fashionista proud!

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone this cosmic repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/utkarshpophli/gemma-finetuning-keras-lora.git
cd gemma-finetuning-lora
```

2. **Suit up with the right gear:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Ignite the training sequence:**
```
python src/train.py
```

4. **Launch the Streamlit spaceship:**
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🗺️ Project Constellation

- `src/`: The engine room where all the AI magic happens
- `app.py`: Your control panel to interact with the fabulous fine-tuned Gemma
- `config.py`: The blueprint for our AI makeover
- `logger.py`: Our cosmic diary keeper

## 🎭 The Cast

- **Gemma**: Our talented AI star, ready for her big performance
- **LoRA**: The magical stylist giving Gemma her glow-up
- **You**: The brilliant director orchestrating this AI masterpiece

## 🎬 Behind the Scenes

This project is like giving Gemma a starring role in her own blockbuster movie. We start with her raw talent (pre-trained model), send her to LoRA's beauty school (fine-tuning), and then watch her dazzle the audience (generate amazing responses) in her new role!

## 🏆 Achievements Unlocked

- 🧠 Brain Boost: Gemma now understands context like a champ
- 🚀 Speed Demon: Responses faster than a caffeinated coder
- 🎭 Adaptation Master: Gemma can now switch roles quicker than a chameleon

## 🛠️ Tinker Time

Feel free to tweak the `config.py` file to experiment with different:
- 🎭 LoRA ranks (how dramatic should Gemma's makeover be?)
- 📏 Sequence lengths (how long-winded should we allow Gemma to be?)
- 🏋️ Batch sizes (how many scripts should Gemma memorize at once?)

## 🌈 Fun Facts

- If Gemma were a coffee, she'd be a triple shot espresso after this fine-tuning
- The number of parameters we're training is smaller than the number of stars you can see on a clear night (but the results are just as magical)

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

- Shoutout to the Keras team for making AI as easy as pie (a very complex, multi-layered pie)
- High-five to the LoRA inventors for showing us that sometimes, less really is more
- Virtual hugs to the open-source community for being awesome

Now go forth and make Gemma shine brighter than a supernova! 🌟✨
